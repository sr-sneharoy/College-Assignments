*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **1.1 Introduction**  
The chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of database systems, highlighting their importance in modern computing. It discusses the role of databases in handling large amounts of data efficiently and ensuring that users can access, modify, and manage data securely and effectively.

---

### **1.2 Database System Applications**  
Databases are used in a variety of real-world applications, including:  
- **Enterprise Information Systems** – Banking, finance, airline reservations, and telecommunications.  
- **Manufacturing & Engineering** – Computer-aided design (CAD) and robotics.  
- **Multimedia Databases** – Storing and managing images, videos, and audio.  
- **Geographical Information Systems (GIS)** – Location-based data analysis.  
- **Real-time & Embedded Systems** – Databases used in sensors and Internet of Things (IoT).  
- **Web & Social Media** – Managing vast amounts of user-generated content.  

---

### **1.3 Purpose of Database Systems**  
The section explains why databases are essential and how they address the limitations of traditional file-based systems. Problems with file-based systems include:  
- **Data Redundancy & Inconsistency** – Multiple copies of data leading to mismatches.  
- **Difficulty in Accessing Data** – Custom programs are required for each query.  
- **Data Isolation** – Scattered data across multiple files makes integration difficult.  
- **Integrity Problems** – Enforcing constraints is complex.  
- **Atomicity Problems** – In case of failures, partial transactions may cause inconsistency.  
- **Security Issues** – File systems have weak security mechanisms compared to databases.  

Databases provide solutions by offering **data abstraction, consistency, security, and atomicity guarantees**.

---

### **1.4 View of Data**  
This section explains the **three levels of database abstraction**:  
1. **Physical Level** – How data is stored (e.g., file structures, indexes).  
2. **Logical Level** – The structure and relationships of data (e.g., tables, schemas).  
3. **View Level** – The user’s perspective (e.g., reports, application interfaces).  

Databases also support **data independence**, meaning changes in the physical storage structure do not affect the logical structure, and vice versa.

---

### **1.5 Database Languages**  
- **Data Definition Language (DDL)** – Defines schema structure (e.g., `CREATE TABLE`).  
- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)** – Queries and modifies data (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`).  
- **Structured Query Language (SQL)** – The standard language for relational databases.  
- **Host Language Embedding** – SQL can be embedded in programming languages like Python, Java, or C++.  

---

### **1.6 Database Design**  
The database design process includes:  
- **Conceptual Design** – High-level data modeling (e.g., Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams).  
- **Logical Design** – Translating the conceptual model into a database schema.  
- **Physical Design** – Choosing data structures, indexing methods, and storage techniques.

---

### **1.7 Database Users & Administrators**  
1. **Users**:  
   - **End Users** – Access databases via applications.  
   - **Application Programmers** – Develop software that interacts with databases.  
   - **Sophisticated Users** – Write direct SQL queries.  
   - **Database Administrators (DBA)** – Manage security, backup, tuning, and recovery.  

2. **Administrators' Responsibilities**:  
   - Schema definition  
   - Storage structure and access method selection  
   - Managing user permissions and security  
   - Ensuring database performance and reliability  

---

### **1.8 Transaction Management**  
A **transaction** is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. Key properties (**ACID**) ensure reliable processing:  
- **Atomicity** – Transactions are either fully completed or fully rolled back.  
- **Consistency** – Transactions maintain database integrity.  
- **Isolation** – Concurrent transactions do not interfere with each other.  
- **Durability** – Once committed, changes persist despite system failures.  

---

### **1.9 Database Architecture**  
Common database architectures include:  
1. **Centralized Database Systems** – All data is stored in a single location.  
2. **Client-Server Architecture** – Users interact with a database server via applications.  
3. **Distributed Databases** – Data is spread across multiple locations for better performance.  
4. **Cloud Databases** – Hosted on cloud platforms, offering scalability and remote access.  

---

### **1.10 Database System Structure**  
A typical database system consists of several key components:  
- **Storage Manager** – Manages disk storage and memory allocation.  
- **Query Processor** – Translates SQL queries into executable plans.  
- **Transaction Manager** – Ensures ACID properties are met.  
- **Concurrency Control** – Manages simultaneous user access.  

---

### **1.11 History of Database Systems**  
- **Hierarchical & Network Models** (1960s–1970s) – Data organized in tree or graph structures.  
- **Relational Model** (1970s–present) – Introduced by E.F. Codd; based on tables.  
- **Object-Oriented & NoSQL Databases** (1990s–present) – Handling complex data types and scalability.  

---

### **1.12 Summary**  
The chapter provides an overview of database systems, explaining their need, architecture, users, and evolution. It establishes foundational concepts that will be explored in more detail in later chapters.

---

### **Detailed Summary of Chapter 2: Introduction to the Relational Model**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **2.1 Introduction**  
This chapter introduces the **relational model**, the foundation of most modern database systems. The relational model represents data in tables (relations) and provides a strong theoretical basis for data management, enabling efficient querying and data integrity.

---

### **2.2 Structure of Relational Databases**  
A **relational database** consists of a collection of **relations** (tables), each containing **tuples** (rows) and **attributes** (columns).  

#### **Basic Terminology**  
- **Relation (Table)** – A set of tuples with the same structure.  
- **Tuple (Row)** – A single data record in a relation.  
- **Attribute (Column)** – A property or field within a relation.  
- **Domain** – The set of possible values an attribute can take.  
- **Degree (Arity)** – The number of attributes in a relation.  
- **Cardinality** – The number of tuples in a relation.  

Example relation: **Students**  

| Student_ID | Name    | Age | Major   |  
|------------|--------|-----|--------|  
| 101        | Alice  | 20  | CS     |  
| 102        | Bob    | 22  | Math   |  
| 103        | Carol  | 21  | Physics|  

Each row represents a **tuple**, and each column represents an **attribute**.

---

### **2.3 Database Schema and Instances**  
- **Database Schema** – The logical structure of a database, including table definitions, attributes, and constraints.  
- **Relation Schema** – The structure of a single relation, specifying its attributes and their types.  
- **Database Instance** – The actual data stored in the database at a given time (changes dynamically).  

For the **Students** relation, the schema can be written as:  
`Students(Student_ID, Name, Age, Major)`

---

### **2.4 Keys**  
Keys help uniquely identify tuples in a relation and enforce integrity constraints.  

#### **Types of Keys**  
- **Superkey** – A set of attributes that uniquely identifies a tuple.  
- **Candidate Key** – A minimal superkey (no attribute can be removed without losing uniqueness).  
- **Primary Key** – One candidate key chosen as the main identifier (e.g., `Student_ID`).  
- **Foreign Key** – An attribute in one relation that references a primary key in another relation.  

Example:  
In a `Courses` table, `Instructor_ID` may be a **foreign key** referencing the `Instructors` table.

---

### **2.5 Relational Query Languages**  
Relational query languages allow users to retrieve and manipulate data.  
- **Procedural Query Language** – Requires users to specify *how* to retrieve data. (e.g., Relational Algebra)  
- **Declarative Query Language** – Users specify *what* data to retrieve. (e.g., SQL, Relational Calculus)  

---

### **2.6 Relational Operations**  
The relational model supports various operations to retrieve and manipulate data.  

#### **Basic Operations in Relational Algebra**  
1. **Selection (σ)** – Filters rows based on a condition.  
   - `σ Age > 21 (Students)` → Returns students older than 21.  
2. **Projection (π)** – Extracts specific columns from a relation.  
   - `π Name, Major (Students)` → Retrieves only `Name` and `Major` columns.  
3. **Union (∪)** – Combines tuples from two relations (removes duplicates).  
4. **Set Difference (-)** – Finds tuples present in one relation but not another.  
5. **Cartesian Product (×)** – Merges every tuple of one relation with every tuple of another.  
6. **Join (⨝)** – Combines relations based on a common attribute (foreign key relationships).  

---

### **2.7 Integrity Constraints**  
**Integrity constraints** ensure data consistency and accuracy.  

1. **Domain Constraints** – Restrict attribute values to a predefined domain (e.g., `Age` must be a positive integer).  
2. **Key Constraints** – Ensure uniqueness of tuples using primary keys.  
3. **Referential Integrity** – Foreign key values must reference existing primary key values.  
4. **Not Null Constraint** – Prevents attributes from having NULL values where necessary.  

Example: If `Student_ID` is the primary key in `Students`, it **must** be unique and **cannot** be NULL.

---

### **2.8 Logical Database Design**  
- The relational model supports **logical independence**, meaning schema changes do not affect applications.  
- **Normalization** is used to minimize redundancy and improve efficiency.  

---

### **2.9 The E-R Model and the Relational Model**  
- The **Entity-Relationship (E-R) model** is often converted into a relational schema.  
- Entities become **relations**, and relationships are implemented using **foreign keys**.  
- Constraints in the E-R model (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) are enforced in the relational schema.  

Example: A **one-to-many** relationship between **Students** and **Courses** is implemented with a **foreign key** in the `Enrollments` table.

---

### **2.10 Relational Database Design**  
Good database design avoids:  
- **Redundancy** – Leads to wasted space and inconsistencies.  
- **Anomalies** – Issues in insertion, deletion, and updates due to redundancy.  
- **Poor Performance** – Inefficient queries due to improper indexing or structure.  

Techniques such as **normalization** and **indexing** help improve design quality.

---

### **2.11 Summary**  
The chapter provides a foundational understanding of the **relational model**, covering key concepts like:  
- Structure of relational databases (tables, tuples, attributes).  
- Schema vs. instance.  
- Keys (primary, foreign, candidate).  
- Relational query languages and algebraic operations.  
- Integrity constraints ensuring database consistency.  
- Database design best practices.  

The **relational model** is the basis for SQL-based database systems, making it one of the most widely used data models today.

### **Detailed Summary of Chapter 3: Introduction to SQL**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **3.1 Overview of SQL**  
SQL (**Structured Query Language**) is the standard language for interacting with relational databases. It provides commands for:  
- **Defining** database schemas (**DDL – Data Definition Language**).  
- **Manipulating** data (**DML – Data Manipulation Language**).  
- **Querying** databases (**SELECT statements**).  
- **Controlling** database access (**DCL – Data Control Language**).  

SQL is a **declarative language**, meaning users specify *what* they want, and the database system determines *how* to retrieve it.

---

### **3.2 Data Definition Language (DDL)**  
DDL commands define and manage the database structure.  

#### **Creating Tables**  
The `CREATE TABLE` command defines a relation, specifying attributes, data types, and constraints.  

Example:  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT CHECK (Age > 0),
    Major VARCHAR(30) DEFAULT 'Undeclared'
);
```
- `Student_ID` is the **primary key**.  
- `CHECK (Age > 0)` ensures **valid age values**.  
- `DEFAULT 'Undeclared'` assigns a **default value** to `Major`.  

#### **Altering Tables**  
Modify an existing table structure using `ALTER TABLE`.  
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students ADD GPA DECIMAL(3,2);
ALTER TABLE Students DROP COLUMN GPA;
```

#### **Deleting Tables**  
The `DROP TABLE` command permanently removes a table and all its data.  
```sql
DROP TABLE Students;
```

---

### **3.3 Basic Structure of SQL Queries**  
The `SELECT` statement retrieves data from tables.  

#### **Basic Query Structure**  
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

Example:  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS';
```
- Retrieves `Name` and `Age` of students majoring in **CS**.  

#### **Wildcard (`*`) for All Columns**  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students;
```
- Returns **all** columns from the `Students` table.  

---

### **3.4 Expressions and Strings in SQL**  
SQL supports **arithmetic expressions** and **string operations**.  

#### **Arithmetic Operations**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age + 1 AS NextYearAge FROM Students;
```
- Computes `Age + 1` for each student.  

#### **String Operations**  
- Concatenation (`||` in PostgreSQL, `+` in SQL Server, `CONCAT()` in MySQL).  
```sql
SELECT Name || ' is studying ' || Major AS Info FROM Students;
```

- Pattern matching with `LIKE`:  
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Name LIKE 'A%';
```
- Finds names starting with **"A"**.  

---

### **3.5 Basic Query Operations**  
#### **Selection (`WHERE` clause)**  
Filters rows based on conditions.  
```sql
SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age >= 21;
```

#### **Projection (Selecting Specific Columns)**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Major FROM Students;
```

#### **Sorting Results (`ORDER BY`)**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students ORDER BY Age DESC;
```
- Sorts results by `Age` in **descending** order.  

---

### **3.6 Set Operations in SQL**  
SQL supports **union, intersection, and difference** operations.  

#### **Union (`UNION`)** – Combines results from two queries, removing duplicates.  
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS'
UNION
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Major = 'Math';
```

#### **Intersection (`INTERSECT`)** – Returns common results.  
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS'
INTERSECT
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Age > 20;
```

#### **Difference (`EXCEPT` or `MINUS`)** – Returns rows in the first query that are **not** in the second.  
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS'
EXCEPT
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Age < 21;
```

---

### **3.7 Aggregate Functions in SQL**  
SQL provides built-in functions for summarizing data.  

#### **Common Aggregate Functions**  
- `COUNT(*)` – Counts rows.  
- `SUM(column)` – Computes total.  
- `AVG(column)` – Calculates average.  
- `MIN(column)` / `MAX(column)` – Finds min/max values.  

Example:  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Students;
SELECT AVG(Age) FROM Students;
```

#### **Grouping Data (`GROUP BY`)**  
Used with aggregate functions to group results.  
```sql
SELECT Major, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY Major;
```
- Counts students in each **Major**.  

#### **Filtering Groups (`HAVING`)**  
Used **after** `GROUP BY` to filter grouped results.  
```sql
SELECT Major, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY Major HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
```
- Displays **majors** with more than **5 students**.  

---

### **3.8 Nested Queries (Subqueries)**  
SQL allows **queries within queries**.  

#### **Using a Subquery in `WHERE` Clause**  
```sql
SELECT Name FROM Students WHERE Age = (SELECT MAX(Age) FROM Students);
```
- Finds **oldest student**.  

#### **Using a Subquery in `FROM` Clause**  
```sql
SELECT AVG(Age) FROM (SELECT Age FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS');
```
- Computes **average age of CS students**.  

---

### **3.9 Modification of the Database**  
#### **Inserting Data (`INSERT`)**  
```sql
INSERT INTO Students (Student_ID, Name, Age, Major) 
VALUES (104, 'David', 23, 'CS');
```

#### **Updating Data (`UPDATE`)**  
```sql
UPDATE Students SET Age = Age + 1 WHERE Major = 'CS';
```

#### **Deleting Data (`DELETE`)**  
```sql
DELETE FROM Students WHERE Age < 18;
```

---

### **3.10 Joined Relations in SQL**  
SQL allows combining multiple tables using **joins**.  

#### **Types of Joins**  
1. **Inner Join** (Default) – Returns matching rows.  
```sql
SELECT Students.Name, Enrollments.Course_ID 
FROM Students 
JOIN Enrollments ON Students.Student_ID = Enrollments.Student_ID;
```

2. **Left Join** – Keeps all records from the **left** table.  
```sql
SELECT Students.Name, Enrollments.Course_ID 
FROM Students 
LEFT JOIN Enrollments ON Students.Student_ID = Enrollments.Student_ID;
```

3. **Right Join** – Keeps all records from the **right** table.  
4. **Full Join** – Keeps all records from both tables.  

---

### **3.11 Views in SQL**  
A **view** is a virtual table based on a query.  

#### **Creating a View**  
```sql
CREATE VIEW CS_Students AS 
SELECT Name, Age FROM Students WHERE Major = 'CS';
```
- Now, `CS_Students` can be queried like a table.  

#### **Dropping a View**  
```sql
DROP VIEW CS_Students;
```

---

### **3.12 Summary**  
This chapter covers:  
- **SQL Basics** – `SELECT`, filtering, sorting.  
- **Set Operations** – `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`.  
- **Aggregates** – `COUNT`, `AVG`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`.  
- **Nested Queries** – Subqueries in `WHERE`, `FROM`.  
- **Joins** – `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` joins.  
- **Views** – Creating virtual tables.  

SQL is a **powerful language** for defining, querying, and managing relational databases.

### **Detailed Summary of Chapter 4: Intermediate SQL**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **4.1 Complex Integrity Constraints in SQL**  
SQL supports several **integrity constraints** to maintain data correctness and consistency.  

#### **Primary Key Constraint**  
Ensures each row has a **unique** and **non-null** identifier.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Age INT
);
```

#### **Foreign Key Constraint**  
Ensures **referential integrity** between related tables.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    Student_ID INT,
    Course_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES Students(Student_ID)
);
```

#### **ON DELETE / ON UPDATE Actions**  
Controls behavior when referenced records change.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollments (
    Student_ID INT,
    Course_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Student_ID) REFERENCES Students(Student_ID)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
    ON UPDATE SET NULL
);
```
- `CASCADE` → Deletes related records.  
- `SET NULL` → Sets foreign key values to `NULL`.  

#### **CHECK Constraints**  
Defines a condition that data must satisfy.  
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Age INT CHECK (Age >= 18)
);
```

---

### **4.2 Triggers in SQL**  
A **trigger** is an action that executes automatically when an event occurs (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).  

#### **Creating a Trigger**  
Example: Prevent insertion of students younger than 18.  
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER check_student_age
BEFORE INSERT ON Students
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN (NEW.Age < 18)
BEGIN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Age must be at least 18';
END;
```

#### **Types of Triggers**  
- **BEFORE Triggers** – Execute before the event.  
- **AFTER Triggers** – Execute after the event.  
- **INSTEAD OF Triggers** – Replace an event with a different action.  

---

### **4.3 Recursive Queries**  
SQL allows recursion for hierarchical data (e.g., organizational charts, bill of materials).  

#### **Example: Finding Employee Hierarchy**  
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeHierarchy AS (
    SELECT Employee_ID, Manager_ID FROM Employees WHERE Manager_ID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.Employee_ID, e.Manager_ID FROM Employees e
    JOIN EmployeeHierarchy eh ON e.Manager_ID = eh.Employee_ID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeHierarchy;
```
- **Base Case**: Employees without a manager.  
- **Recursive Step**: Fetch employees reporting to retrieved managers.  

---

### **4.4 OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) Features**  
SQL includes **OLAP functions** for advanced analytics.  

#### **GROUPING SETS**  
Allows multiple grouping levels in a single query.  
```sql
SELECT Major, Age, COUNT(*) 
FROM Students 
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((Major), (Age), (Major, Age));
```

#### **CUBE & ROLLUP**  
- **ROLLUP** – Aggregates data with subtotals.  
- **CUBE** – Computes all possible groupings.  
```sql
SELECT Major, Age, COUNT(*) 
FROM Students 
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Major, Age);
```

---

### **4.5 Window Functions**  
SQL **window functions** allow calculations across a set of rows **without** collapsing them.  

#### **Ranking Functions**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Age DESC) AS Rank 
FROM Students;
```
- **RANK()** – Assigns a rank, skipping numbers for ties.  
- **DENSE_RANK()** – Assigns a rank without skipping numbers.  

#### **Running Totals**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age, SUM(Age) OVER (ORDER BY Age) AS RunningTotal
FROM Students;
```

---

### **4.6 Case Studies**  
SQL can solve real-world problems such as:  
- **Customer segmentation** using `CASE` statements.  
- **Fraud detection** using **window functions**.  
- **Inventory tracking** using **triggers and stored procedures**.  

Example: Categorizing students by age group.  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age,
    CASE 
        WHEN Age < 20 THEN 'Teenager'
        WHEN Age BETWEEN 20 AND 25 THEN 'Young Adult'
        ELSE 'Adult'
    END AS AgeGroup
FROM Students;
```

---

### **4.7 Summary**  
This chapter covered advanced SQL topics, including:  
- **Constraints** (`PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `CHECK`).  
- **Triggers** for automatic rule enforcement.  
- **Recursive Queries** for hierarchical data.  
- **OLAP Features** (`ROLLUP`, `CUBE`).  
- **Window Functions** (`RANK()`, `SUM() OVER`).

### **Detailed Summary of Chapter 5: Advanced SQL**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **5.1 SQL Data Types and Schemas**  
SQL provides a variety of **data types** to store different kinds of data.  

#### **Common Data Types**  
- **Numeric Types**: `INT`, `DECIMAL(p,s)`, `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`  
- **Character Types**: `CHAR(n)`, `VARCHAR(n)`  
- **Date/Time Types**: `DATE`, `TIME`, `TIMESTAMP`  
- **Boolean Type**: `BOOLEAN` (Stores `TRUE`, `FALSE`, `NULL`)  

#### **Schema Definition**  
A **schema** groups related database objects (tables, views, indexes).  
```sql
CREATE SCHEMA University AUTHORIZATION admin;
```
- Defines a **University schema** under the **admin user**.  

---

### **5.2 Index Definition in SQL**  
Indexes **speed up query performance** by allowing faster lookups.  

#### **Creating an Index**  
```sql
CREATE INDEX StudentIndex ON Students (Name);
```
- Speeds up queries filtering by `Name`.  

#### **Unique Index**  
Ensures values in a column are unique.  
```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX UniqueStudent ON Students (Student_ID);
```

#### **Composite Index**  
Indexes multiple columns for better performance.  
```sql
CREATE INDEX MultiColumnIndex ON Enrollments (Student_ID, Course_ID);
```

#### **Dropping an Index**  
```sql
DROP INDEX StudentIndex;
```

---

### **5.3 SQL Functions and Procedural Constructs**  
SQL supports **user-defined functions (UDFs)** and **stored procedures** for complex operations.  

#### **Stored Procedures**  
A **stored procedure** is a reusable SQL code block that performs an operation.  

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE UpdateStudentAge (IN StudentID INT, IN NewAge INT)
BEGIN
    UPDATE Students SET Age = NewAge WHERE Student_ID = StudentID;
END;
```
- **IN** parameters: Accept values when calling the procedure.  
- **BEGIN ... END**: Defines the procedure block.  

#### **Executing a Stored Procedure**  
```sql
CALL UpdateStudentAge(101, 22);
```

#### **Functions**  
Functions return a single value.  
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION GetStudentCount() RETURNS INT
BEGIN
    DECLARE count INT;
    SELECT COUNT(*) INTO count FROM Students;
    RETURN count;
END;
```
- Retrieves the total number of students.  

---

### **5.4 Recursive Queries Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
CTEs simplify **hierarchical data retrieval**.  

#### **Example: Employee Hierarchy**  
```sql
WITH RECURSIVE EmployeeTree AS (
    SELECT Employee_ID, Manager_ID FROM Employees WHERE Manager_ID IS NULL
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.Employee_ID, e.Manager_ID FROM Employees e
    JOIN EmployeeTree et ON e.Manager_ID = et.Employee_ID
)
SELECT * FROM EmployeeTree;
```
- **Base Case**: Retrieves top-level employees.  
- **Recursive Step**: Finds employees reporting to managers.  

---

### **5.5 Advanced Aggregation**  
SQL provides **advanced aggregation functions** beyond `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.  

#### **GROUPING SETS**  
Allows multiple levels of aggregation in a single query.  
```sql
SELECT Major, Age, COUNT(*)
FROM Students
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((Major), (Age), (Major, Age));
```

#### **ROLLUP & CUBE**  
- **ROLLUP**: Computes hierarchical subtotals.  
- **CUBE**: Computes all possible aggregations.  

```sql
SELECT Major, Age, COUNT(*) 
FROM Students 
GROUP BY ROLLUP (Major, Age);
```

---

### **5.6 Window Functions for Analytics**  
SQL **window functions** operate over a set of rows **without collapsing them**.  

#### **Ranking Functions**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Age DESC) AS Rank 
FROM Students;
```
- **RANK()** – Assigns a rank, skipping numbers for ties.  
- **DENSE_RANK()** – No gaps in ranking.  

#### **Running Totals**  
```sql
SELECT Name, Age, SUM(Age) OVER (ORDER BY Age) AS RunningTotal
FROM Students;
```

---

### **5.7 Transactions and Concurrency Control**  
SQL supports **transactions** to ensure data consistency.  

#### **Transaction Properties (ACID)**  
- **Atomicity**: Either all operations execute, or none.  
- **Consistency**: Maintains database integrity.  
- **Isolation**: Prevents interference from other transactions.  
- **Durability**: Ensures committed changes persist.  

#### **Using Transactions**  
```sql
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE Student_ID = 105;
COMMIT;
```
- `COMMIT`: Saves changes permanently.  
- `ROLLBACK`: Undoes all changes since the last commit.  

#### **Setting Isolation Levels**  
```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
```
- **READ UNCOMMITTED**: Allows dirty reads.  
- **READ COMMITTED**: Prevents dirty reads.  
- **REPEATABLE READ**: Prevents non-repeatable reads.  
- **SERIALIZABLE**: Strictest level, avoids all anomalies.  

---

### **5.8 Security and Access Control**  
SQL provides mechanisms to **restrict access** to data.  

#### **User Privileges**  
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON Students TO User1;
```
- Grants `SELECT` and `INSERT` privileges on `Students` to `User1`.  

```sql
REVOKE INSERT ON Students FROM User1;
```
- Removes `INSERT` privileges.  

#### **Views for Security**  
```sql
CREATE VIEW StudentNames AS 
SELECT Name FROM Students;
```
- Allows controlled access to data.  

---

### **Detailed Summary of Chapter 6: Formal Relational Query Languages**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

### **6.1 Introduction to Formal Query Languages**  
Formal relational query languages provide a **precise mathematical foundation** for database queries.  
- These languages define how data can be retrieved and manipulated using **set theory and logic**.  
- The two main formal query languages:  
  1. **Relational Algebra** (procedural)  
  2. **Relational Calculus** (declarative)  

Formal query languages help define the **theoretical foundation** for SQL and other practical query languages.  

---

## **6.2 Relational Algebra**  
Relational Algebra is a **procedural language** that describes how queries are executed using operations on relations (tables).  
- Queries are composed of **basic operations** that take one or more relations as input and produce a new relation as output.  

### **Basic Operations in Relational Algebra**  

#### **1. Selection (σ) – Filtering Rows**  
Selects tuples (rows) that satisfy a condition.  
```sql
σ Age > 18 (Students)
```
- Retrieves students **older than 18**.  

#### **2. Projection (π) – Selecting Columns**  
Extracts specific attributes (columns) from a relation.  
```sql
π Name, Age (Students)
```
- Retrieves only `Name` and `Age` columns from `Students`.  

#### **3. Union (∪) – Combining Relations**  
Combines tuples from two relations (similar to `UNION` in SQL).  
```sql
Students_Engineering ∪ Students_Science
```
- Returns students enrolled in either Engineering or Science.  
- Requires **both relations to have the same schema**.  

#### **4. Set Difference (−) – Finding Exclusive Tuples**  
Finds tuples in one relation but not in another.  
```sql
Students_Engineering − Students_Science
```
- Retrieves students **only** in Engineering (not in Science).  

#### **5. Cartesian Product (×) – Combining Relations Without Condition**  
Combines **every tuple** from one relation with **every tuple** from another.  
```sql
Students × Courses
```
- Produces all possible student-course pairs.  

#### **6. Join (⨝) – Combining Relations Based on Condition**  
Joins two relations based on a common attribute.  

- **Natural Join (⨝)**: Matches tuples with common attribute values.  
```sql
Students ⨝ Enrollments
```
- **Theta Join (⨝ condition)**: Uses a specific condition.  
```sql
Students ⨝ (Students.Student_ID = Enrollments.Student_ID) Enrollments
```
- **Equi-Join**: Special case of theta join using `=` condition.  

#### **7. Division (÷) – Finding Related Tuples**  
Used when a relation should contain all values in another relation.  
```sql
(A ÷ B)
```
- Finds students who are enrolled in **all** courses of a particular set.  

---

## **6.3 Extended Relational Algebra Operations**  
SQL introduces some advanced relational algebra operations to improve query power.  

### **1. Aggregate Functions**  
Includes **SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX**.  
```sql
GPA ← AVG(Grade) (Students)
```
- Finds the average grade of students.  

### **2. Grouping (γ) – Grouping Tuples**  
Similar to SQL’s `GROUP BY`.  
```sql
γ Major, COUNT(*) (Students)
```
- Groups students by `Major` and counts them.  

### **3. Outer Joins**  
Handles missing data by keeping tuples from one relation even if they don’t have a match.  
- **Left Outer Join (⟕)**: Keeps all tuples from the left relation.  
- **Right Outer Join (⟖)**: Keeps all tuples from the right relation.  
- **Full Outer Join (⟗)**: Keeps all tuples from both relations.  

---

## **6.4 Tuple Relational Calculus (TRC)**  
A **declarative** query language based on **predicate logic**.  
- Specifies **what to retrieve** rather than **how** to retrieve it.  
- Queries return tuples that satisfy a given condition.  

### **Syntax of TRC**  
A TRC query has the form:  
```sql
{ t | P(t) }
```
Where:  
- `t` is a tuple variable.  
- `P(t)` is a condition that `t` must satisfy.  

### **Example Queries**  

#### **Find all students older than 18**  
```sql
{ t | t ∈ Students ∧ t.Age > 18 }
```
- Returns all tuples `t` from `Students` where `Age > 18`.  

#### **Find names of students enrolled in "Database" course**  
```sql
{ s.Name | ∃ e ∈ Enrollments (s.Student_ID = e.Student_ID ∧ e.Course_Name = "Database") }
```
- Uses **∃ (existential quantifier)** to check if a student is enrolled in the "Database" course.  

#### **Find students enrolled in all courses**  
```sql
{ s | ∀ c ∈ Courses (∃ e ∈ Enrollments (e.Student_ID = s.Student_ID ∧ e.Course_ID = c.Course_ID)) }
```
- Uses **∀ (universal quantifier)** to check if a student is enrolled in **all** courses.  

---

## **6.5 Domain Relational Calculus (DRC)**  
Similar to **Tuple Relational Calculus**, but based on **domains of attributes** rather than tuples.  

### **Syntax of DRC**  
A DRC query has the form:  
```sql
{ <x1, x2, ..., xn> | P(x1, x2, ..., xn) }
```
Where:  
- `x1, x2, ..., xn` are attribute values.  
- `P(x1, x2, ..., xn)` is a condition.  

### **Example Queries**  

#### **Find student names who are older than 18**  
```sql
{ <Name> | ∃ Age (Students(Name, Age) ∧ Age > 18) }
```
- Returns `Name` where `Age > 18`.  

#### **Find students enrolled in "Database" course**  
```sql
{ <Name> | ∃ ID, Course (Students(ID, Name) ∧ Enrollments(ID, Course) ∧ Course = "Database") }
```
- Retrieves students who have an enrollment in the **Database** course.

## **6.6 Comparison of Query Languages**  

| Feature                | Relational Algebra | Tuple Relational Calculus | Domain Relational Calculus |
|------------------------|-------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Type**               | Procedural        | Declarative              | Declarative              |

| **Usage**              | Theoretical basis for SQL | Used for formal queries | Used for formal queries |

- **Relational Algebra**: Specifies **how** queries are executed.  
- **Relational Calculus (TRC, DRC)**: Specifies **what** data to retrieve.  
- SQL is based on **Relational Algebra and Calculus** concepts.  

---

# **Detailed Summary of Chapter 7: Database Design and the E-R Model**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

## **7.1 Overview of Database Design**  
Database design involves:  
1. **Requirements Analysis** – Understanding user needs.  
2. **Conceptual Design** – Using the **Entity-Relationship (E-R) Model**.  
3. **Logical Design** – Mapping E-R diagrams to **Relational Schema**.  
4. **Normalization** – Refining schema to remove redundancy.  

The **E-R Model** is a high-level data model used to design a database by defining its entities, relationships, and constraints.  

---

## **7.2 The Entity-Relationship Model**  
The **E-R Model** represents data in terms of:  
- **Entities** – Objects in the real world (e.g., Student, Course).  
- **Attributes** – Properties of entities (e.g., Name, Age).  
- **Relationships** – Associations between entities (e.g., Enrolled in).  

### **Components of the E-R Model**  

### **1. Entities and Entity Sets**  
- An **entity** is a **real-world object** (e.g., a student).  
- An **entity set** is a **collection of similar entities** (e.g., all students).  
- Entities have **attributes** that describe them.  

#### **Example: Student Entity Set**
| Student_ID | Name   | Age | Major  |
|------------|--------|-----|--------|
| 101        | Alice  | 20  | CS     |
| 102        | Bob    | 22  | Math   |

### **2. Attributes**  
Each entity has **attributes** that store information.  
- **Simple (Atomic) Attributes**: Cannot be divided (e.g., Age).  
- **Composite Attributes**: Can be divided into sub-parts (e.g., Name → First Name, Last Name).  
- **Derived Attributes**: Computed from other attributes (e.g., Age from Date of Birth).  
- **Multivalued Attributes**: Can have multiple values (e.g., Phone Numbers).  

#### **Example: Attributes for Student Entity**  
- **Simple**: `Student_ID, Age`  
- **Composite**: `Name = (First_Name, Last_Name)`  
- **Derived**: `Age = Current Year - Birth Year`  
- **Multivalued**: `Phone Numbers = {123-4567, 789-0123}`  

### **3. Relationships and Relationship Sets**  
A **relationship** describes an association between two or more entities.  
A **relationship set** is a collection of similar relationships.  

#### **Example: Relationship Between Student and Course**
- **Entities**: `Student`, `Course`  
- **Relationship**: `Enrolled`  
- **Attributes of Relationship**: `Grade, Year`  

### **4. Degree of a Relationship**  
- **Unary (Recursive)**: Relationship within the same entity set.  
- **Binary**: Relationship between two entity sets (most common).  
- **Ternary**: Relationship involving three entity sets.  

---

## **7.3 Mapping Cardinalities (Relationship Constraints)**  
Cardinality defines the **number of entity instances** that can participate in a relationship.  

### **Types of Mapping Cardinalities**  
1. **One-to-One (1:1)** – Each entity in set A is related to at most one entity in set B.  
   - Example: **Employee** is assigned **one Company Car**.  
2. **One-to-Many (1:M)** – One entity in set A can be related to many entities in set B.  
   - Example: **Professor** teaches multiple **Courses**, but each **Course** has only one **Professor**.  
3. **Many-to-Many (M:N)** – Many entities in set A are related to many entities in set B.  
   - Example: **Students** enroll in multiple **Courses**, and each **Course** has multiple **Students**.  

#### **Example E-R Diagram for Student-Course Relationship**  
```
(Student) --- (Enrolled) --- (Course)
  1:M
```

---

## **7.4 Keys in the E-R Model**  
Keys uniquely identify an entity in an entity set.  

### **Types of Keys**  
- **Primary Key** – Uniquely identifies an entity (e.g., `Student_ID`).  
- **Candidate Key** – A minimal set of attributes that can be used as a primary key.  
- **Super Key** – A set of attributes that uniquely identify an entity but may include extra attributes.  
- **Foreign Key** – An attribute in one entity set that references a primary key in another entity set.  

---

## **7.5 Weak Entities and Strong Entities**  
- **Strong Entity**: Has a **primary key** and exists independently.  
- **Weak Entity**: Does **not** have a primary key and relies on a **strong entity**.  

#### **Example: Weak Entity – Dependents of an Employee**
- **Employee (Strong Entity)** → `Employee_ID (PK)`  
- **Dependent (Weak Entity)** → `Dependent_Name, Age (no PK)`  
- **Identifying Relationship**: Each **Dependent** is related to one **Employee**.  

---

## **7.6 Enhanced E-R (EER) Model**  
Extends the E-R model with concepts like:  

### **1. Generalization (Bottom-Up Approach)**  
Combining **multiple entity sets** into a **higher-level entity set**.  
- Example: **Car, Truck, and Motorcycle** → **Vehicle**.  

### **2. Specialization (Top-Down Approach)**  
Dividing a **higher-level entity set** into **lower-level entity sets**.  
- Example: **Employee** → **Professor, Administrator, Staff**.  

### **3. Aggregation**  
- Used when **a relationship itself** has attributes.  
- Example: **"Manages"** relationship between **Employee** and **Department** has an attribute **"Start_Date"**.  

---

## **7.7 Reducing an E-R Diagram to Relational Schema**  
The **E-R model** is converted into a **relational schema** for database implementation.  

### **Conversion Steps**  
1. **Convert Entity Sets to Tables**  
   - Each **entity set** becomes a **table**.  
   - Attributes become **columns**.  
2. **Convert Relationships to Tables**  
   - **1:1 and 1:M** relationships → Use **foreign keys**.  
   - **M:N relationships** → Create a **new table**.  
3. **Convert Weak Entities**  
   - Add **foreign key** to reference the **strong entity**.  
4. **Handle Specialization & Generalization**  
   - **Option 1**: Store all entities in one **table** with a **type attribute**.  
   - **Option 2**: Create separate **tables for each specialized entity**.  

---

## **7.8 Summary**  
This chapter covered the **conceptual design** of databases using the **Entity-Relationship Model**:  
- **Entities, Attributes, Relationships**  
- **Mapping Cardinalities (1:1, 1:M, M:N)**  
- **Keys (Primary, Candidate, Foreign)**  
- **Weak and Strong Entities**  
- **Generalization, Specialization, Aggregation**  
- **Converting an E-R Model into a Relational Schema**  

The **E-R Model** is crucial for designing well-structured databases before implementing them in SQL.

# **Detailed Summary of Chapter 8: Relational Database Design**  
*(From Database System Concepts, Sixth Edition by Abraham Silberschatz, Henry F. Korth, S. Sudarshan)*  

---

## **8.1 Features of a Good Relational Database Design**  
A **good database design** ensures:  
- **Minimal Redundancy**: Avoids unnecessary duplication of data.  
- **Data Integrity**: Maintains consistency and accuracy of data.  
- **Efficient Query Processing**: Optimizes storage and retrieval.  
- **Flexibility and Scalability**: Supports future modifications.  

### **Problems in Poorly Designed Databases**  
1. **Redundancy** – Repeated data increases storage and update anomalies.  
2. **Insertion Anomalies** – Cannot insert data without unnecessary dependencies.  
3. **Deletion Anomalies** – Deleting one piece of data removes useful related information.  
4. **Update Anomalies** – Modifying one value requires multiple updates in different places.  

### **Example of a Badly Designed Table**
| Student_ID | Name  | Course | Instructor | Instructor_Office |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------------|
| 101        | Alice | DBMS   | Prof. X    | Room 101          |
| 102        | Bob   | DBMS   | Prof. X    | Room 101          |
| 103        | Charlie | OS   | Prof. Y    | Room 102          |

#### **Problems in the Table**  
- **Redundancy**: `Instructor` and `Instructor_Office` are repeated for each course.  
- **Update Anomaly**: If `Prof. X` moves to another office, multiple records must be updated.  
- **Deletion Anomaly**: If the last student from `OS` is deleted, information about `Prof. Y` is lost.  

---

## **8.2 Functional Dependencies (FDs)**  
A **Functional Dependency (FD)** is a constraint that expresses a relationship between attributes in a relation.  
- **Definition**: If `X → Y`, then knowing `X` means we can determine `Y`.  
- Example: `Student_ID → Name, Age, Major`  
  - If we know `Student_ID`, we can determine `Name`, `Age`, and `Major`.  

### **Types of Functional Dependencies**  
1. **Trivial FD**: If `Y` is a subset of `X`, then `X → Y` is trivial.  
   - Example: `{Student_ID, Name} → Name`  
2. **Non-Trivial FD**: If `Y` is not a subset of `X`, then `X → Y` is non-trivial.  
   - Example: `Student_ID → Name`  
3. **Completely Non-Trivial FD**: If `X` and `Y` have no overlap, then `X → Y` is completely non-trivial.  
   - Example: `Course → Instructor`  

---

## **8.3 Decomposition and Normalization**  
### **Decomposition**  
Decomposition breaks a **large relation** into **smaller relations** to eliminate redundancy and anomalies.  

**Properties of a Good Decomposition**  
1. **Lossless-Join Decomposition** – No information loss when relations are joined.  
2. **Dependency Preservation** – Ensures all functional dependencies remain intact.  

---

## **8.4 Normal Forms**  
Normalization is the **process of structuring a database** to remove redundancy and ensure data integrity.  

### **First Normal Form (1NF) – Remove Multivalued Attributes**  
A relation is in **1NF** if:  
- All attributes contain **atomic (indivisible) values**.  
- Each column contains **only a single value per row**.  

#### **Example (Not in 1NF)**
| Student_ID | Name  | Courses        |
|------------|-------|---------------|
| 101        | Alice | DBMS, OS      |
| 102        | Bob   | DBMS          |

#### **Solution (1NF)**
| Student_ID | Name  | Course |
|------------|-------|--------|
| 101        | Alice | DBMS   |
| 101        | Alice | OS     |
| 102        | Bob   | DBMS   |

---

### **Second Normal Form (2NF) – Remove Partial Dependencies**  
A relation is in **2NF** if:  
- It is already in **1NF**.  
- **No partial dependency** exists (i.e., no attribute depends on only part of a composite primary key).  

#### **Example (Not in 2NF)**
| Student_ID | Course | Instructor |
|------------|--------|------------|
| 101        | DBMS   | Prof. X    |
| 102        | OS     | Prof. Y    |

- **Functional Dependency**: `{Student_ID, Course} → Instructor`.  
- **Problem**: `Instructor` depends only on `Course`, not on `Student_ID`.  

#### **Solution (2NF)**  
Decompose into two tables:  
1. **Student-Course Table**
   | Student_ID | Course |
   |------------|--------|
   | 101        | DBMS   |
   | 102        | OS     |

2. **Course-Instructor Table**
   | Course | Instructor |
   |--------|------------|
   | DBMS   | Prof. X    |
   | OS     | Prof. Y    |

---

### **Third Normal Form (3NF) – Remove Transitive Dependencies**  
A relation is in **3NF** if:  
- It is in **2NF**.  
- **No transitive dependency** exists (`X → Y` and `Y → Z`, then `X → Z`).  

#### **Example (Not in 3NF)**
| Student_ID | Name  | Course | Instructor | Instructor_Office |
|------------|-------|--------|------------|--------------------|
| 101        | Alice | DBMS   | Prof. X    | Room 101          |
| 102        | Bob   | OS     | Prof. Y    | Room 102          |

- **Functional Dependencies**:  
  - `Course → Instructor`  
  - `Instructor → Instructor_Office` (**Transitive Dependency**)  

#### **Solution (3NF)**  
Decompose into:  
1. **Student-Course Table**
   | Student_ID | Name  | Course |
   |------------|-------|--------|
   | 101        | Alice | DBMS   |
   | 102        | Bob   | OS     |

2. **Course-Instructor Table**
   | Course | Instructor |
   |--------|------------|
   | DBMS   | Prof. X    |
   | OS     | Prof. Y    |

3. **Instructor-Office Table**
   | Instructor | Instructor_Office |
   |------------|------------------|
   | Prof. X    | Room 101         |
   | Prof. Y    | Room 102         |

---

### **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) – Stronger 3NF**  
A relation is in **BCNF** if:  
- It is in **3NF**.  
- **For every functional dependency (X → Y), X must be a superkey**.  

BCNF removes **anomalies** that may still exist in **3NF**.  

---

## **8.5 Multivalued Dependencies and Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**  
A relation is in **4NF** if:  
- It is in **BCNF**.  
- **No multivalued dependencies exist** (when one attribute depends on another without a functional dependency).  

Example of a multivalued dependency:  
- `Employee →→ Skills` (Employee can have multiple skills).  

---

## **8.6 Summary**  
This chapter introduced **Relational Database Design** concepts:  
- **Functional Dependencies (FDs)**  
- **Decomposition** and its properties  
- **Normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF, 4NF)**  
- **How to remove anomalies and redundancy**  

A well-designed database **improves efficiency** and **ensures data integrity**.
